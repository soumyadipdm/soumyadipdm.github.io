Hey there, I am a technology enthusiast who likes to play/break/fix opensource software products. I love Linux, but am fluent in administrating FreeBSD, Solaris.

I believe all the boring/repetative tasks should be delegated to computers as they are good at it. To instruct them, everyone should know programming. I can code in C, Python, GO, PERL, Shell etc. and have been contributing to opensource projects.

My current employer is LinkedIn, where I get to tease myself addressing scalability issues of different component of infrastructure.
