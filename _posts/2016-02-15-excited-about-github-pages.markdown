So I have been trying to move to github pages for a while, mostly because I wanted to blog in the comfort of commandline and markdown.

I do have a Wordpress site [jotdownux.wordpress.com](http://jotdownux.wordpress.com) and I have been blogging there for more than a year now. But, at this point I am not sure if I will continue posting there.

I will try to write stuffs every day, if not once a week at least. Let's see how things turn out.
