So this is my first post on github pages. I have been meaning to build my own github page for a while, mostly because of posting from commandline and markdown.

I do have a Wordpress site: (jotdownux.wordpress.com)[https://jotdownux.wordpress.com/] but at this point I am not sure if I am going to continue with that site.

I hope to post everyday but can't really commit to it yet :)
