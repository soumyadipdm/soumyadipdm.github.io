I have trying to learn [Go](http://golang.org/) for a while, but for one or the other reason could not start it properly. The other day I thought it's the right time to start learning Go, I have an idea in my mind (more of that will come later) and Go would a perfect fit to deal with it.

So I grabbed ["The Go Programming Language"](http://www.amazon.in/Go-Programming-Language-Alan-Donovan/dp/9332569711) book and started reading. It's fun of course to learn Go, I know C and I can see the similarities (not many, but look and feel are quite similar).

I have "The C Programming Language", "Python Cookbook", and now "The Go Programming Language", all side by side. It's going to be fun!
